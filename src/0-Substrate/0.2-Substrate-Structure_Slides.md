# Substrate Structure

---

## How to approach Substrate

- From **_within_**.
  - Mostly relevant when wanting to work on substrate itself.
- From **_without_**.
  - Mostly relevant when wanting to build on top of substrate.

---

## Substrate internal components

3 main parts:

- Client: `./client`: `sc-*`
- FRAME: `./frame`: `frame-*`, `pallet-*`
- Primitives: `./primitives`: `sp-*`


Notes:

Primitives is the glue between the other two.

---v

### `./client`

- block-builder
- consensus
- database
- networking
- transaction pool

---v

### `./frame`

- modules that compose the runtime.
  - balances/currency (Bitcoin)
  - Wasm/Solidity smart contracts (Ethereum)
  - transaction-payment
  - staking
  - identity
  - proxy / (onchain) multisig
  - ...

---v

### `./primitives`

- crypto primitives
- runtime-api/host-functions
- various types and traits definitions

### Get familiar, be smart

- Getting a good idea of this structure will help you navigate the codebase.

- Networking? only on `sc-*`
- Database/Storage? Probably in `sc-*` and `sp-*`

### Development Freedom

### Some built examples

- `bin/kitchensink-node`.
- `bin/node-template`.
- The entire `polkadot` repo.
