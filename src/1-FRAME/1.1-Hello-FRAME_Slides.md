# Hello FRAME

---

## What is FRAME?

FRAME is a Rust framework for building Substrate runtimes.

---

## But what it really is ?

A collection of macros and APIs that take care of:

- Make it easy for developers
- Providing flexibility
- Providing modularity
- Don't go too far away from Rust

Notes:

Writing the Sudo Pallet:
Without FRAME: 2210 lines of code.
With FRAME: 310 lines of code.
7x Smaller.

- `wc -l` will show the number of lines of a file.
- `cargo expand` will expand the macros to "pure" Rust.


---

## Pallets, our building blocks!

With FRAME runtimes are composed of individual modules.

## Anatomy of a Pallet

- Extrinsics ( dispatchable calls )
- Storage items
- Hooks for:
  - Block initialization and finalization.
  - and others...

Notes:

_!= block finality i.e. GRANDPA_

---

## Anatomy of a Pallet

- Events
- Errors
- Offchain workers
- A lot more!

### Anatomy of a Pallet

```rust
pub use pallet::*;
#[frame_support::pallet]
pub mod pallet {
   use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
   use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;

   #[pallet::pallet]
   #[pallet::generate_store(pub(super) trait Store)]
   pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

   #[pallet::config]
   pub trait Config: frame_system::Config { ... }

   #[pallet::event]
   pub enum Event<T: Config> { ... }

   #[pallet::error]
   pub enum Error<T: Config> { ... }

   #[pallet::storage]
   #[pallet::getter(fn something)]
   pub type MyStorage<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u32>;

   #[pallet::call]
   impl<T:Config> Pallet<T> { ... }
}
```

Notes:

Each attribute is a macro

---

## The one and only FRAME System

A Pallet which is assumed to always exist when using FRAME. Present in the `Config` of every Pallet:

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config { ... }
```
Defines common types and functions that are basic for a blockchain.

Notes:

- Block Number
- Accounts
- Hash

---

## The orchestrator, FRAME Executive

Coordinates and defines the order that the runtime will execute on.

Notes:

- Initialize Block
  - `on_runtime_upgrade` and `on_initialize` hooks
- Initial Checks
- Signature Verification
- Execute Extrinsics
  - `on_idle` and `on_finalize` hooks
- Final Checks

---

## Construct Runtime macro

`construct_runtime!` macro is in charge of creating the runtime by composing the FRAME pallets that were previously configured.

```rust
construct_runtime!(
	pub struct Runtime
	where
		Block = Block,
		NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
		UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic,
	{
		System: frame_system,
		RandomnessCollectiveFlip: pallet_randomness_collective_flip,
		Timestamp: pallet_timestamp,
		Aura: pallet_aura,
		Grandpa: pallet_grandpa,
		Balances: pallet_balances,
		TransactionPayment: pallet_transaction_payment,
		Sudo: pallet_sudo,
		// Include the custom logic from the pallet-template in the runtime.
		TemplateModule: pallet_template,
	}
);
```

---

## How does configuring a Pallet look like

Every Pallet has a `Config`  which defines what needs to be configured.
This `Config` is defined in the pallet itself and configured(implemented) in the runtime.

---

### How does configuring a Pallet look like

```rust
/// Configure the pallet by specifying the parameters and types on which it depends.
	#[pallet::config]
	pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
		/// Because this pallet emits events, it depends on the runtime's definition of an event.
		type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;
		/// Type representing the weight of this pallet
		type WeightInfo: WeightInfo;
	}
```

---

### How does configuring a Pallet look like

```rust

impl pallet_sudo::Config for Runtime {
	type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
	type RuntimeCall = RuntimeCall;
	type WeightInfo = pallet_sudo::weights::SubstrateWeight<Runtime>;
}

```
