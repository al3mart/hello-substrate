# FRAME Calls

---

## FRAME Calls

Interaction door for users to the runtime.
We call these **Extrinsics**

Notes:

Users submit an **extrinsic** to the blockchain, which is **dispatched** to a Pallet **call**.

---

## Defining FRAME calls

```rust
#[pallet::call]
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
	#[pallet::call_index(7)]
	#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::transfer_allow_death())]
	pub fn transfer(
		origin: OriginFor<T>,
		dest: AccountIdLookupOf<T>,
		#[pallet::compact] value: T::Balance,
	) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
		let source = ensure_signed(origin)?;
		let dest = T::Lookup::lookup(dest)?;
		<Self as fungible::Mutate<_>>::transfer(&source, &dest, value, Expendable)?;
		Ok(().into())
	}
}
```

Notes:

Calls are just functions which are implemented on top of the `Pallet` struct.

You can do this with any kind of function, however, "FRAME magic" turns these into dispatchable calls through the `#[pallet::call]` macro.

---

## Origin


```rust
/// Origin for the System pallet.
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Clone, RuntimeDebug, Encode, Decode, TypeInfo, MaxEncodedLen)]
pub enum RawOrigin<AccountId> {
	/// The system itself ordained this dispatch to happen: this is the highest privilege level.
	Root,
	/// It is signed by some public key and we provide the `AccountId`.
	Signed(AccountId),
	/// It is signed by nobody, can be either:
	/// * included and agreed upon by the validators anyway,
	/// * or unsigned transaction validated by a pallet.
	None,
}
```

---

## And usually the first thing is...

```rust
let caller: T::AccountId = ensure_signed(origin)?;
```

Notes:

Normally, the first thing you do in a call is check that the origin of the caller is what you expect.
Most often, this is checking that the extrinsic is `Signed`, which is a transaction from a user account.

---

## MUST NOT Panic

Allowing callers to trigger a panic from a call can allow users to attack your chain by bypassing fees or other costs associated with executing logic on the blockchain.

---

## Return

Every call returns a `DispatchResult`:

```rust
pub type DispatchResult = Result<(), sp_runtime::DispatchError>;
```

This allows you to handle errors in your runtime, and NEVER PANIC!

---

## Returning an Error

At any point in your call logic, you can return a `DispatchError`.

```rust
ensure!(new_balance >= min_balance, Error::<T, I>::LiquidityRestrictions);
```

Notes:

Thanks to transactional storage layers, all modified state will be reverted.

---v

## Errors

Each Pallet will define its own set of errors

```rust
// Errors inform users that something went wrong.
#[pallet::error]
pub enum Error<T> {
	/// There is currently no owner set.
	NoOwner,
	/// The calling user is not authorized to make this call.
	NotAuthorized,
}
```

Notes:

When writing tests, you can use errors to make sure that your functions execute exactly as expected.
Errors are encoded based on the index of the pallet in the runtime and its index in the `Error` enum.

---

## Returning success

If everything in your pallet completed successfully, you simply return `Ok(())`, and all your state changes are committed, and the extrinsic is considered to have executed successfully.

But during the execution you might want to let users / clients know that something has happened.

---

## Emitting events

```rust
// Pallets use events to inform users when important changes are made.
#[pallet::event]
#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
pub enum Event<T: Config> {
	/// Event documentation should end with an array that provides descriptive names for event
	/// parameters. [something, who]
	SomethingStored { something: u32, who: T::AccountId },
}
```

Emitting this event looks like:

```rust
// Emit an event.
Self::deposit_event(Event::SomethingStored { something, who });
```

---

## As a good practice

Label your calls with a `call_index`.

```rust
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
```
So future changes in the Pallet don't lead to breaking changes in the transaction format.

Notes:

Cover what can happen after a runtime upgrade if these indices change.

---

## Encoding

Any Pallet call is represented by:

1. The Pallet Index -> comes from `construct_runtime!` macro. 
1. The Call Index

Notes:

Point to be a good practice explicitly set indices for pallets in `construct_runtime!`.
Note that this also implies there can only be 256 calls per pallet due to the 1 byte encoding.

---

## Weights

This attribute tells how much running this fucntion costs, and translates into how much should the user be charged.

```rust
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::transfer_allow_death())]
```

Weights are obtained after running benchmarks for the Pallets, but this is its own topic.
