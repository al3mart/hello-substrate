title: FRAME Pallet Coupling
---

# Pallet Coupling

---

## Pallet Coupling

Substrate enables building modular and composable blockchain runtimes.

So the building blocks of a FRAME runtime can interact with each other.

---

## Pallet "interaction" comes in two falvors 

- Tightly Coupling

  - Directly connected with each other.
  - A runtime featuring a pallet which is tightly coupled with another, must have the latter configured too.

- Loosely Coupling

  - Connecting Pallets via traits.
  - Which Pallets need to be present in the runtme ? Any that satisfies the required traits.

---

## Tightly coupling

Easier but less flexible

It looks like this:

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config + pallet_treasury::Config {
	// -- snip --
}
```

Everything is tightly coupled to `frame_system`!

Notes:

almost like an extension to another pallet.

---

## An example

`pallet_treasury`

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config<I: 'static = ()>: frame_system::Config { ... }
```

`pallet_tips` & `pallet_bounties`

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config<I: 'static = ()>: frame_system::Config + pallet_treasury::Config<I> { ... }
```

---

## Another example

Examples:

```rust
// Get the block number from `frame_system`
frame_system::Pallet::<T>::block_number()
```

```rust
// Use type configurations defined in another pallets.
// ensure_signed is a function defined in `frame_system`
let who: T::AccountId = ensure_signed(origin)?;
```

```rust
// Dispatch an error defined in another pallet.
ensure!(
	bounty.value <= max_amount,
	pallet_treasury::Error::<T, I>::InsufficientPermission
);
```

Notes:

With tight coupling, you have direct access to all public functions and interfaces of another pallet. Just like directly using a crate / module.

---

## Loosely coupling

Modularity shines with loosly coupling! 

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
	/// The parachain registrar type.
	type Registrar: Registrar<AccountId = Self::AccountId>;
	// -- snip --
}
```

Notes:

One need to define a tarit that can be provided and depended on. This trait will be implemented by another pallet which is present in the same runtime.
[Example](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/41982b517b3405583cad877aa2af4e27925ac73b/runtime/common/src/paras_registrar.rs#L412)

---

## Loosely coupling

This Pallet is able to call any functions defined in the trait!

```rust 
let manager = T::Registrar::manager_of(id).ok_or(Error::<T>::ParaDoesntExist)?;
```

---

## Everything coming together


The runtime configuration where things are no longer "loosely" defined.
Let's jump into the code and have a quick look!
