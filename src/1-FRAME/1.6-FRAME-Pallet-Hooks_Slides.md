1. `on_initialize`
1. `on_finalize`
1. `on_idle`
1. `on_runtime_upgrade`
1. `offchain_worker`
1. `integrity_test`

## `on_initialize`

- Useful for any kind of **automatic** operation that will run at the beguinning of each block.
- Called before any transaction.
- Weight interpreted as `DispatchClass::Mandatory`.

Notes:

should be lightweight and predictable.

---

## `on_finalize`

Its weight needs to be known in advance.

Similar to `on_initialize`, `on_finalize` is also **mandatory**. This is also why its weight is
registered at the beginning of the block.

Notion:
Less preferred tha on_initialize
Only use this if REALLY needed
Sometimes, rather than thinking "at the end of block N", consider writing code "at the beginning of block N+1"

---

## `on_idle`

- Run before `on_finalize` and only if there is some remaining weight.
- **_Optional_** variant of `on_finalize`, also executed at the end of the block.

---

## `on_runtime_upgrade`

Called at runtime version changes before anything else!

Notes:

This one we can laverage to perform data migrations if needed.
